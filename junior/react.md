### Components

React components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based.

- **Functional Components**: Simpler components defined as functions.

**Example:**

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};

export default Greeting;
