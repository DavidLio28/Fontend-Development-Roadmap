## Version Control

### Git

Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes to your code and collaborate with others.

- **Basic Commands:**
  - `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
  - `git clone <repo-url>`: Clone a remote repository.
  - `git add <file>`: Stage changes for commit.
  - `git commit -m "message"`: Commit staged changes with a message.
  - `git push origin <branch>`: Push commits to a remote repository.
  - `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.

**Example:**

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
