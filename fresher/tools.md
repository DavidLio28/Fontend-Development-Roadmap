## Version Control

### Git

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during development. It allows you to manage versions of your codebase and collaborate with others.

- **Basic Commands**:
  - `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
  - `git add .`: Stage changes for commit.
  - `git commit -m "message"`: Commit changes with a message.
  - `git push`: Push changes to a remote repository.

## Package Managers

### npm

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows you to install and manage dependencies for your projects.

- **Common Commands**:
  - `npm install package-name`: Install a package.
  - `npm update`: Update packages.
  - `npm run script-name`: Run a script defined in `package.json`.

## Task Runners

### Gulp

Gulp is a task runner that automates repetitive tasks in your development workflow, such as minification, compilation, and linting.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Streams**: Use streams to handle data processing.
  - **Tasks**: Define tasks in a `gulpfile.js` to automate workflows.

## Testing Tools

### Jest

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that works with various libraries and frameworks, including React. It provides:

- **Easy Setup**: Zero-config setup for most projects.
- **Snapshot Testing**: Track changes in component output.
- **Mocking**: Mock functions and modules to isolate tests.
