## Introduction to React

### What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive user experience. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of their applications efficiently.

### Core Concepts

- **Components**: The building blocks of a React application. Components can be functional or class-based.
- **Props**: Short for properties, props are used to pass data from parent to child components.
- **State**: Manages dynamic data within a component, allowing the UI to change based on user interactions or other events.

## Creating a React App

### Using Create React App

The easiest way to get started with React is to use the Create React App tool, which sets up a new React project with a good default configuration.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
