## JavaScript Basics

### Syntax and Operators

JavaScript syntax includes variables, operators, and expressions. Common operators include:

- **Assignment Operator (`=`)**: Assigns a value to a variable.
- **Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)**: Perform mathematical operations.
- **Comparison Operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<`, `>`)**: Compare values.
- **Logical Operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)**: Perform logical operations.

```javascript
let x = 10; // Assignment
let y = 5;
let sum = x + y; // Addition
let isEqual = (x === y); // Comparison
