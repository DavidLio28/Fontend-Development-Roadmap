## System Design

### Monolithic vs Microservices

- **Monolithic Architecture**: A single, unified application where all components are tightly coupled. Easier to develop and deploy but can become difficult to scale and maintain as the application grows.

  **Pros:**
  - Simplicity in deployment
  - Easier to develop initially

  **Cons:**
  - Difficult to scale
  - Harder to maintain and update

- **Microservices Architecture**: Breaks down the application into smaller, loosely coupled services. Each service is independent and can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately.

  **Pros:**
  - Scalability and flexibility
  - Independent deployment and development

  **Cons:**
  - Complexity in service communication
  - Requires robust DevOps practices

### Client-Server Architecture

Client-Server Architecture divides the application into two main components: the client and the server. The client interacts with the server to request and display data.

**Example:**

- **Client**: A web browser or mobile app that requests data from the server.
- **Server**: A backend service that processes requests and provides data to the client.

### API Design

Designing APIs involves creating interfaces for different components to interact with each other. Good API design improves usability and maintainability.

**Best Practices:**

- **RESTful API**: Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and structure URLs logically.
- **GraphQL**: Allows clients to request specific data, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.

**Example (RESTful API):**

```plaintext
GET /users           # Retrieve a list of users
POST /users          # Create a new user
GET /users/:id       # Retrieve a specific user
PUT /users/:id       # Update a specific user
DELETE /users/:id    # Delete a specific user
