## Introduction to HTML

### What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a webpage using a series of elements or tags. Each element has an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.

### Basic HTML Structure

A basic HTML document has the following structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
