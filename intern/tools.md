## Version Control

### Git

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your codebase, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your project. Key concepts include:

- Repositories: Storage for your project's files and history.
- Commits: Snapshots of your project's changes.
- Branches: Parallel versions of your project for feature development or experimentation.

To get started with Git, download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the installation instructions.

### GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a collaborative environment for developers to share code, work on projects together, and manage their workflows. Some key features include:

- Pull Requests: Review and merge changes from different branches.
- Issues: Track bugs, enhancements, and tasks.
- Actions: Automate workflows with CI/CD pipelines.

## Development Tools

### Browsers and Developer Tools

Modern web browsers come with built-in developer tools that help you inspect and debug your code. Popular browsers include:

- **Google Chrome**: Developer tools accessible via `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I`.

- **Microsoft Edge**: Developer tools accessible via `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I`.

These tools allow you to inspect the DOM, view and edit CSS, debug JavaScript, and analyze network activity.

### Live Server

Live Server is a development server extension for Visual Studio Code that provides a live reload feature for your static and dynamic pages. It helps you see your changes in real-time without needing to refresh the browser manually.

To install Live Server:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
3. Search for "Live Server" and click "Install".
